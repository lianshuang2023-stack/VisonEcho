## Original AWS sample: Automated Audio Description Using Generative AI

A serverless pipeline that automatically generates **Descriptive Video Information (DVI)** — spoken narrations of visual content inserted during silence gaps in videos — to improve media accessibility for visually impaired audiences.

## Why DVI Matters

Audio description (also called Descriptive Video Information) is essential for making video content accessible to people who are blind or have low vision. Regulators and standards bodies require or recommend it across regions — for example, the FCC's audio-description rules for major US broadcasters, the CRTC's described-video requirements in Canada, and WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.2.5 for web content. This sample demonstrates how generative AI can automate the historically expensive and time-consuming process of creating audio descriptions.

## Overview

This sample deploys a complete end-to-end system that:

1. **Detects silence gaps** in video audio tracks using Amazon Transcribe
2. **Analyzes visual content** during those gaps using the Twelve Labs Pegasus video understanding model via Amazon Bedrock
3. **Generates narration text** from visual analyses using Claude on Amazon Bedrock
4. **Synthesizes speech** from narration text using Amazon Polly
5. **Mixes narration audio** back into the original video using FFmpeg

It includes a web dashboard (React + TypeScript) for triggering the pipeline, viewing results, and estimating per-execution costs.

## Architecture

The system has two parts: a Step Functions processing pipeline that turns a raw video into a described-video output, and a web dashboard for operating it.

### Processing Pipeline

![DVI processing pipeline: a video uploaded to S3 flows through a Step Functions state machine that validates the input, transcribes it with Amazon Transcribe, detects silence gaps, extracts padded video clips, analyzes them with Twelve Labs Pegasus on Amazon Bedrock, generates narration text with Claude, synthesizes speech with Amazon Polly, mixes the narration back into the video with FFmpeg, and writes a summary to DynamoDB and S3.](docs/dvi-pipeline-diagram.png)

### System Architecture

![DVI web dashboard architecture: a React single-page app is served from S3 through Amazon CloudFront, which also proxies /api requests to Amazon API Gateway. API Gateway is protected by an Amazon Cognito authorizer and routes to backend-for-frontend Lambda functions that read from S3, Step Functions, and DynamoDB.](docs/dvi-web-app-diagram.png)

### Application UI

This is the web dashboard deployed — the Viewer page plays a processed video alongside its DVI narration segments.

![Screenshot of the DVI dashboard Viewer page: a video player on the left shows a TV sports broadcast, and a paginated list of timestamped DVI narration segments appears on the right, each with a duration and a PASS/FAIL fit badge.](docs/dvi-dashboard-viewer.png)

### How It Works

1. **Validate** — Checks video file size (< 8 GB) and duration (< 8 hours) before processing
2. **Transcribe** — Amazon Transcribe extracts a full transcript with timestamps
3. **Silence Detection** — Identifies gaps ≥ 4 seconds with no speech: between speech segments, and also _before the first segment_ (intros) and _after the last segment_ (outros), so leading and trailing visuals get described too
4. **Extract Segments** — For each silence gap, extracts a video clip with configurable context padding (default: 5s before, 2s after the gap) so the AI model understands the visual narrative
5. **Analyze** — Twelve Labs Pegasus describes the visual content in each clip
6. **Generate DVI** — Claude generates concise, accessibility-focused narration text from each analysis
7. **Synthesize** — Amazon Polly converts narration text to speech, constrained to fit within the silence duration
8. **Mix** — FFmpeg positions each narration audio at the correct timestamp and mixes it into the original video
9. **Write Summary** — Records a structured per-execution summary (aggregate metrics + per-segment PASS/FAIL fit check) to Amazon DynamoDB, and writes a human-readable text report to Amazon S3

For a deeper, function-by-function explanation of the pipeline and the rationale behind each design choice, see the [backend Lambda guide](backend/LAMBDAS.md).

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with permissions to create Lambda, Step Functions, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFront, and Bedrock resources
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
- **Node.js 20+** (for React frontend build and CDK; Vite 8 requires Node 20.19 or newer)
- **Python 3.12+** (for CDK and Lambda functions)
- **curl** (for downloading the FFmpeg binary)
- **Amazon Bedrock model access** enabled for (the deploy script attempts to enable these automatically — see [Enabling Bedrock Model Access](#enabling-bedrock-model-access)):
  - Twelve Labs Pegasus 1.2 (`us.twelvelabs.pegasus-1-2-v1:0`)
  - Anthropic Claude Sonnet (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`)

### Enabling Bedrock Model Access

In most cases you don't need to do this by hand. As part of `./deploy.sh`, a preflight step **checks whether your account already has access** to the two models the pipeline needs — Twelve Labs Pegasus 1.2 and Anthropic Claude Sonnet — and, if access is missing, **requests it for you automatically** (including the one-time first-use agreement the Anthropic model requires, since both models are offered through AWS Marketplace).

This step is best-effort and safe to re-run. If it can't complete on its own — for example, your credentials lack Marketplace subscribe permissions or your AWS CLI is older than the required version — it prints a warning and lets the deployment continue, so you can grant access manually.

## Deployment

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sample-code-for-automated-audio-description-using-generative-ai

# Deploy everything with one command
./deploy.sh
```

The deploy script will:

1. Install Python CDK dependencies
2. Check (and, if needed, request) Amazon Bedrock model access
3. Bootstrap CDK in your account/region
4. Build the FFmpeg Lambda layer
5. Build the React frontend
6. Deploy two CloudFormation stacks (Pipeline + Dashboard)

Deployment takes approximately 10-15 minutes.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
npx cdk bootstrap

# Build the FFmpeg Lambda layer (downloads a static binary; required before deploy)
bash backend/layers/ffmpeg/build-layer.sh

# Build frontend
cd dashboard/frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ../..

# Deploy
npx cdk deploy --all
```

### Deploy to a Specific Region

```bash
npx cdk deploy --all --context region=us-west-2
```

## Usage

### 1. Sign In to the Dashboard

During deployment, an admin user is automatically created with the email you provided. Check your email for a temporary password from Amazon Cognito.

Open the Dashboard URL (printed in deployment outputs) and sign in with your email and temporary password. You'll be prompted to set a new password on first login.

### 2. Upload a Video

After deployment, upload an MP4 video to the S3 bucket. You can do so directly from the UI, in the "Process" page by clicking on "Choose MP4 file". Alternatively you can also upload it through AWS CLI commands:

```bash
# Get the bucket name from deployment outputs
BUCKET_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name DviPipelineStack \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`BucketName`].OutputValue' \
  --output text)

# Upload your video
aws s3 cp your-video.mp4 s3://$BUCKET_NAME/input/your-video.mp4
```

### 3. Open the Dashboard

The dashboard URL is printed in the deployment outputs. It provides three pages:

- **Process** — Upload an input video and start a pipeline execution (a cost estimate is shown before you confirm)
- **Viewer** — Browse processed videos, watch them with DVI narration, and inspect per-segment detail
- **Cost Estimation** — View per-execution cost estimation breakdowns across all AWS services used

### 4. Trigger the Pipeline

From the Process page in the dashboard:

1. Select an input video
2. Click "Trigger Pipeline"
3. Confirm the execution (a cost estimate is shown)
4. Monitor progress in real-time

## Documentation

- [`backend/LAMBDAS.md`](backend/LAMBDAS.md) — every backend Lambda explained: configuration, key code, and why each design choice was made (including the cost calculator).
- [`dashboard/frontend/FRONTEND.md`](dashboard/frontend/FRONTEND.md) — a short tour of the web dashboard's React frontend: structure, the API/auth layers, and the Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui setup.

## Cost Estimate

The cost of processing a video depends on which AWS services the pipeline uses, how much each one processes (video length, number and length of silence segments, tokens generated, characters synthesized), and the **AWS Region** you deploy to — per-unit prices vary by Region. The pipeline incurs charges across **AWS Lambda**, **AWS Step Functions**, **Amazon Transcribe**, **Amazon Bedrock** (Twelve Labs Pegasus for video understanding and Anthropic Claude for narration text), **Amazon Polly**, **Amazon S3**, and **Amazon DynamoDB**. You can dive deep into the cost estimation logic and implementation in its lambda function definition here [`backend/LAMBDAS.md`](backend/LAMBDAS.md)

The dashboard includes a built-in **Cost Estimation** page that calculates the actual per-execution cost estimate breakdown from each run's own execution history. Here is an example report for a single execution:

![Example DVI Cost Report from the dashboard: a per-service breakdown table covering Step Functions, Lambda, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Bedrock (Pegasus and Claude), and Amazon Polly, listing usage and USD cost for one succeeded execution.](docs/cost-report-example-dvi.png)

## Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
npx cdk destroy --all --force
```

## Limitations

- **Video file size**: Maximum 8 GB (Lambda ephemeral storage constraint). For larger files, re-encode at a lower bitrate or extend the FFmpeg steps to use ECS Fargate.
- **Video duration**: Maximum 8 hours (Amazon Transcribe limit). The pipeline validates both size and duration before processing.
- **Language**: Currently supports English (`en-US`) only for transcription. Modify the `LanguageCode` in `transcribe_video` for other languages.
- **Silence threshold**: Minimum silence duration defaults to 4 seconds and is configurable per pipeline run from the dashboard's Process page (the default lives in `silence_detection/lambda_function.py`). Shorter silences are skipped.
- **Sequential processing**: Silence segments are analyzed one at a time. For videos with many silence gaps, consider using Step Functions Distributed Map for parallel processing.
- **Input format**: Only MP4 files are supported. Files must be placed in the `input/` prefix of the S3 bucket.

## Alternative Approaches

This sample implements a **context-window** approach: for each silence gap, it extracts a clip with padding (5 seconds before the gap + the gap + 2 seconds after) and sends that clip to Pegasus for visual analysis. This provides narrative context while keeping each Pegasus call focused.

Other approaches worth considering for production systems:

### Silence-Only Clips (No Context)

Extract only the exact silence gap — no padding. Pegasus sees just the silent moment.

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheapest (shortest clips → lowest Pegasus cost)        | Pegasus may misinterpret what's happening without narrative context |
| Most precise — guaranteed to describe the right moment | Descriptions may be generic ("a person sits at a desk")             |
| Fastest processing                                     |                                                                     |

### Full-Video Context Summary

Send the entire video to Pegasus once for a high-level summary, then use that summary as context when generating narration for each segment (via Claude's prompt).

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most coherent narrations — understands full narrative arc | Limited by Pegasus input: max 1 hour, < 2 GB                                                                   |
| Can reference characters, plot, setting by name           | Extra Pegasus call adds cost and latency                                                                       |
| Best for episodic/narrative content                       | For videos > 1 hour, requires segmentation into overlapping chunks for summarization, then combining summaries |

**Handling videos longer than Pegasus limits (1 hour / 2 GB):** For the full-video-context approach, videos exceeding Pegasus limits require intelligent segmentation. Split the video into overlapping segments (e.g., 50-minute chunks with 5 minutes of overlap), summarize each segment independently, then combine the per-segment summaries using Claude. Both duration _and_ file size must be validated — a 45-minute 4K video could exceed 2 GB while being under the duration limit.

### Configuring This Sample

The context padding in this sample is configurable via environment variables in the CDK stack:

- `CONTEXT_PAD_BEFORE` — seconds of video before the silence gap (default: 5.0)
- `CONTEXT_PAD_AFTER` — seconds of video after the silence gap (default: 2.0)

The minimum silence gap threshold is configurable per pipeline run via the dashboard UI (default: 4 seconds). Shorter gaps are skipped.

Set both padding values to `0` to replicate the silence-only approach. Increase them for more narrative context.

## Security

The dashboard is protected by Amazon Cognito authentication. All API Gateway endpoints require a valid JWT token. Self-sign-up is disabled — users must be created by an administrator via the AWS CLI or Console.

This is sample code intended for demonstration and learning. It is not production-ready as-is: before deploying it in a production environment, perform a proper security assessment and put reasonable safeguards in place for your use case.
