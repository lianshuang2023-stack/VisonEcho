# Dashboard Frontend

A small React 19 + TypeScript single-page app (built with Vite 8) that runs the DVI
dashboard. It's served as static files from S3 behind CloudFront; CloudFront proxies
`/api/*` to API Gateway, so the app makes same-origin calls with no CORS in normal use.

## Layout

```
src/
  main.tsx            # React entry point
  App.tsx             # Auth gate + page switching (no router)
  api.ts              # The single network layer — all fetch calls live here
  auth.ts             # Cognito (SRP) wrapper; config loaded at runtime
  types.ts            # Shared TypeScript interfaces for API payloads
  components/         # Page + feature components
    ui/               # shadcn/ui primitives (new-york style)
  lib/utils.ts        # cn() class-merge helper
  utils/              # small pure helpers (e.g. formatTime)
  index.css           # Tailwind v4 import + design tokens (@theme + :root)
```

## Key decisions

- **No router.** `App.tsx` holds an `activePage` state (`viewer` / `trigger` / `cost`)
  and toggles each page with `display: contents | none`. Pages stay mounted, so things
  like the Trigger page's live execution polling keep running when you switch tabs.
  Everything is gated behind an auth check that renders `LoginPage` until a Cognito
  session exists. Note: the internal page keys differ from the displayed tab labels in
  `NavBar.tsx` — `trigger` shows as **"Process"**, `viewer` as **"Viewer"**, and `cost`
  as **"Cost Estimation"**; `trigger` (Process) is the default landing page.
- **One API layer (`api.ts`).** Components never call `fetch` directly — they import
  typed functions. Each function calls `authHeaders()` (which throws if unauthenticated),
  checks `res.ok`, and unwraps the relevant field from the JSON envelope. New endpoints
  follow the same shape and add their response type to `types.ts`.
- **Auth (`auth.ts`).** Amazon Cognito via `amazon-cognito-identity-js` (SRP flow). The
  ID-token JWT is attached as the `Authorization` header on every API call. Cognito IDs
  are **not** hardcoded — they're loaded at runtime from `/auth-config.json`, which CDK
  generates at deploy time with the live pool/client IDs.
- **Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui.** App-specific styles use arbitrary-value
  utilities bound to CSS variables (e.g. `bg-[var(--surface-container-low)]`). The
  shadcn primitives in `components/ui` use bare token utilities (`bg-popover`,
  `bg-accent`, …). In Tailwind v4 those utilities only exist if the tokens are registered
  in an `@theme` block, so `index.css` keeps raw values in `:root` **and** exposes them
  via `@theme inline { --color-popover: var(--popover); … }`. Without that mapping the
  primitives render with no background (a transparent dropdown/popover) — keep it in sync
  when adding tokens.
- **State.** Local React state + hooks only; no global store. The Trigger page persists
  the active execution ARN to `localStorage` so a page refresh resumes status polling.
- **Upload.** The Process (Trigger) page includes a `VideoUpload` component that uploads
  an MP4 straight to the pipeline bucket's `input/` prefix via a presigned PUT URL
  (`POST /api/trigger/upload`), so users can add source videos without leaving the UI.

## Build & test

### Local Azure mode

The Azure backend runs separately on `127.0.0.1:8000`. Enable this mode explicitly:

```bash
VITE_LOCAL_BACKEND=true npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174 --strictPort
```

Alternatively, copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`. Vite proxies `/api/*`,
including upload PUTs and video playback, to the local backend without rewriting
the path. This proxy is enabled for development and preview only in local mode.
Both default to port 5174 in local mode, matching the backend origin allowlist.
For a static local build, build with `VITE_LOCAL_BACKEND=true npm run build` and
serve it behind a same-origin `/api` route to the backend. Keep the server bound
to loopback: this mode is intended for use on the local computer.

Only the exact value `VITE_LOCAL_BACKEND=true` skips Cognito and opens Process
directly. When absent or false, the original AWS login and cost pages remain.
The UI reads `GET /api/health` for `{status, provider, model, configured,
speech_region_configured, issues}`. A reachable but unconfigured backend still
allows uploads and viewing; processing is disabled until the required
configuration is present. Use **Recheck configuration** after backend changes.
This check reports configuration presence, not a live cloud service probe.

Azure OpenAI and Speech API keys must stay in the backend environment. Never add
keys to any `VITE_*` variable, browser storage, or frontend file. The local UI
shows Azure usage guidance instead of applying AWS price estimates.

### Commands

- `npm run build` → `tsc -b && vite build`, emits `dist/`, which CDK deploys to the
  hosting bucket. `vite.config.ts` sets `define: { global: "globalThis" }` (required by
  `amazon-cognito-identity-js` in the browser — don't remove it).
- `npx vitest --run` for tests (Vitest + Testing Library, `jsdom`). Pure logic such as
  cost math and time formatting is covered with `fast-check` property tests
  (`*.property.test.ts`).
